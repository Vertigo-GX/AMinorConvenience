# A Minor Convenience
A small server-side/singleplayer Minecraft mod for Fabric that serves as a collection of a few convenience features.

(Note: Has only been tested in singleplayer so far!)

### Features:
* Use (right-click) a flower pot while holding a flower to swap its content for the held flower.
* Use (right-click) a painting while holding a painting to cycle to the next variant of the same size. Holding sneak will cycle to the previous one.
* Touching the ground in Creative mode doesn't cancel flying, same as in Bedrock Edition.
* Enchanted books with a single enchantment show the name of their enchantment instead of the item name.
* All features are optional.

### Configuration:
Either edit the config file (`a-minor-convenience.ini`) found in the Fabric config folder, or use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to edit the options in game.
